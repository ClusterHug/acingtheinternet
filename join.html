<h1>Join Acing The Internet!</h1>
<h2>Criteria to join</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must be asexual (identities under the asexual spectrum count).
<li>You must have a personal site where you can put the webring widget, does not have to be hosted on Neocities.
<li>If your site contains any NSFW content, it must be clearly marked as 18+.
<li>Your site must not have any hate speech or bigotry.
<li>Bigotry here includes generalized/blanket statements or rants about marginalized identities, even those you may belong to yourself, that would make someone of that identity potentially uncomfortable to see. See the note below for more on this.
<li>Your site cannot be advertisement-focused (having a page/section with your social media links is fine and mentioning that you're, for example, an artist who takes commissions is fine, but the sole purpose of the website should not be advertisement).
<li>You must add the webring widget somewhere on either a homepage or a webrings page. If we notice the webring widget is removed, we may remove you from the webring and send you an email to notify you of the issue.
<li>We strongly encourage visiting your fellow webring members' pages, leaving comments, and interacting with each other!
</ul>

<small>It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we (the webmasters) reserve the right to remove a site if we feel it is outside of our own personal bounds.</small>
<small>Since someone got wildly upset today over me rejecting their webring application due to blanket statements on lesbians being acephobic on their website, and wrote a blog post accusing me of both supporting acephobic lesbians and tone-policing an ace lesbian criticizing a community I'm "not a part of", AND used racism and transphobia within the lesbian communities to argue that blanket statements about lesbians being bigoted are fine, I feel it is important to reiterate that this rule about bigotry is to make the members of this webring feel welcome no matter what other identities they belong to, and that I am part of a DID system with multiple asexual lesbian members who were the ones to make this decision in particular (one of them, Jupiter, is writing this statement). Talking about intracommunity issues is fine, but generalized sweeping statements attacking an incredibly oppressed identity that already has enough shit to deal with, even if you yourself belong to that group, is still bigoted. Besides this, I am a transgender mixed native, and I will not tolerate white cis people using my oppression as a prop for their argument. I can't believe I'm having to add this, but racism, transphobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, acephobia, homophobia, and other bigotry will NOT be tolerated, and microaggressions are STILL bigotry (which can still be committed against a group you're a part of, it is not tone-policing to recognize that).</small>
