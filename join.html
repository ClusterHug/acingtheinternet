<h1>Join Acing The Internet!</h1>
<h2>Criteria to join</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must be asexual (identities under the asexual spectrum count).
<li>You must have a personal site where you can put the webring widget, does not have to be hosted on Neocities.
<li>If your site contains any NSFW content, it must be clearly marked as 18+.
<li>Your site must not have any hate speech or bigotry.
<li>Your site cannot be advertisement-focused (having a page/section with your social media links is fine and mentioning that you're, for example, an artist who takes commissions is fine, but the sole purpose of the website should not be advertisement).
<li>You must add the webring widget somewhere on either a homepage or a webrings page. If we notice the webring widget is removed, we may remove you from the webring and send you an email to notify you of the issue.
<li>We strongly encourage visiting your fellow webring members' pages, leaving comments, and interacting with each other!
</ul>

<small>It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we (the webmasters) reserve the right to remove a site if we feel it is outside of our own personal bounds.</small>
